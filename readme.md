This repository contains python code that implements common machine learning algorithms from scratch. ie without making use of libraries like scikit-learn, tensorflow or pytorch. Numpy will be used for efficient matrix and vetor operations and matplotlib for plotting our results. 

The code I write here is not optimized, a little unreadable, and i havent written any comments.
I might come back to it to improve the code to make it more readable and mentainable but feel free to make changes to optimize or even collaborate to make custom libraries.
